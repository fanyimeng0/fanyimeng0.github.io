  Hi, my name's Fanyi Meng and I'm pursuing my M.Phil of Computer and Information Engineering in The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHKSZ). 
  I am co-supervised by [Dr. Guangxu Zhu](https://sites.google.com/view/guangxuzhu) and [Prof Tsung-Hui Chang](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/faculty/tsunghuichang).

  I received B.Eng from Southern University of Technology (Sustech) in Communication Engineering in 2023, supervised by [Prof Rui Wang](http://lasso.eee.sustech.edu.cn/).
  
  My research interests include Integrated Sensing and Communication(ISAC), Digital Twin and Machine Learning. I am looking for a Ph.D. program in ECE or CSE for the year 2025. If there are any available openings, please inform me via email!

          Improving overall QoS performance by changing EDCA parameters.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Utilized MATLAB's WLAN Toolbox for simulation of the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) within the Wi-Fi MAC layer.

          Utilized NS-3 to analyze the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) mechanism in 802.11ac, focusing on throughput and latency.

          Refined EDCA parameters to achieve Proportional Fairness in Channel Allocation for WiFi networks. Patent application acceptance (202310862296.7)(202310857615.5).

          Verified our results in Linux 5.15 by Hacking Wi-Fi Driver. More detail in (https://github.com/iamhyc/wlsops-hack)

          Extracted Channel State Information (CSI) from Wi-Fi signals on Intel 5300 NIC, ESP32, and Router RT-AC86U.
         
          Built a Wi-Fi Sensing System for data collection, model training, and function visualization.
          
          Used BERT-based neural network to address packet loss challenges in Wi-Fi Sensing tasks.
          
          Employed three Intel 5300 NICs for sub-2-second latency in real-time human tracking and localization.
